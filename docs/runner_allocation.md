We have a

- `bot-events` (on demand, responds to GitHub webhook events) - any available runner
- `bot-feedstocks` - 1 runner
- `bot-make-graph` - 1 runner
- `bot-make-migrators` - 1 runner
- `bot-prs` - 4 runners
- `bot-pypi-mapping` - 1 runner
- `bot-update-status-page` - 1 runner
- `bot-update-nodes` - 3 runners
- `bot-versions` - 6 runners
- `docker` (on demand) - 1 runner
- `keepalive` - 1 runner
- `relock` - 1 runner
- `test-model` (daily for ~4 minutes, on demand) - 1 runner
- `tests` (on demand) - 1 runner

Total: 16 runners used permanently, 4 runners can be used on demand.
