"""
This module contains global settings for the bot.
For each setting available as `SETTING_NAME`, there is an environment variable available as `ENV_SETTING_NAME`
that can be used to override the default value.
Note that there is no further validation of environment variables as of now.
To make settings easier to understand for humans, we use explicit type annotations.
